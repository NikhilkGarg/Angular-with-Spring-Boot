        Donating blood is a safe and simple process that uses single-use sterile supplies. Nevertheless, on
        rare occasions, temporary medical complications may be associated with donating blood, including
        bruising, dizziness, fainting, nausea and even more rarely, infection and nerve injury. Drinking plenty
        of fluids and eating well can help reduce reactions. It is important for donors to follow the post-donation
        instructions provided by the UCLA Blood & Platelet Center staff in order to help manage or avoid
        developing complications after the donation is completed.</p> 
        <ul>
          <li>
            I have read and understand the information provided about donating blood. I am aware that my
            child (listed below) plans to make a voluntary donation.
          </li>
          <li>
            My child is at least 16 years old.
          </li>
          <li>
            I understand that my child will answer confidential questions regarding his or her health history.
          </li>
          <li>
            I understand that all donated blood will undergo laboratory testing for viral agents and diseases,
            including HIV, Syphilis, Hepatitis B virus, Hepatitis C virus, and other infectious agents as
            required by applicable laws or regulations. These tests are performed to protect the patients who
            receive blood. Testing for other infectious agents may involve the use of investigational tests.
          </li>
          <li>
            Abnormal (positive) test results will be disclosed by law and the donor will be notified. In some
            cases, blood center staff may need to discuss test results with the donor. Per California law, it
            is the donorâ€™s decision whether his/her parents/guardians are to be included in that discussion.
          </li>
          <li>
            I understand that donated blood is intended for patient use; any blood that cannot be used for
            patients (for example, due to positive test results) may be used for other purposes.
